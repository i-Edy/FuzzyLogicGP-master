# Fuzzy Logic Java Framework
This framework is developed in Java version 14.

# Logics:
  * Zadeh
  * AMBC
  * GMBC

# Membership Functions:
  * Gaussian
  * Sigmoidal
  * Negative sigmoidal
  * Singleton
  * Triangular
  * Trapezoidal
  * LTrapezoidal
  * RTrapezoidal
  * Gamma
  * LGamma
  * Pseudo-exp
  * SForm
  * ZForm
  * FPG
  * Nominal
  * Map-Nominal

# Supported query types:
  * Predicate Evaluation
  * Predicate Discovery (you can use multiple generators to substitute variables in the guide predicate).

# Current algorithms:
  * For predicate evaluation.
  * GA for optimization of FPG functions.
  * GA for predicate Discovery.
# Notes
Input datasets in CSV and XLSX format supported.

Input query in JSON and EDN format.

Export data result in CSV, JSON format only (In the evaluation query you can see a json representation of the evaluated predicate).

Plot of membership function (current deploy in html).
